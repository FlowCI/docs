## What is flow.ci?

flow.ci is an open-source CI/CD automation server that designed for reducing the complexity and increasing user experience. It supports high availability, multiple building environment, and scalability with dynamic agents.

- __High Availability__

    flow.ci is designed to work in the cloud -- public, private, or hybrid, it could be deployed with multiple instances, the configuration/jobs data on the node may not be lost when the instance fails.

- __High Performance__

    - __scaling__: automatically scale agent either on K8s cluster or Linux host
    - __parallel__: job steps can be executed in parallel on multiple agents
    - __cache__: cache anything to speed up the build

- __Zero Configuration__

    flow.ci tries to minimize the complexity of any configuration, the server could be started with three command lines. It also provides build templates of many programming languages, a job could be started just using it.

- __Online Debugging__
    
    flow.ci supports the online TTY terminal so that you could find out the problems in the running job from runtime terminal.

- __Flexible Plugins__

    Using plugins on flow.ci is quite simple, you just need type the plugin name in the step. Developing a plugin is also quite easy, you could use any language on your own plugin development. 

- __Flexible Runtime__ 
  
    Each step or step group can be run either on any docker images or native os.
